# Joconde

This app aims to be:

- An example of state of the art app setup we use at BAM
- A repository where our app setup documentation is tested
- A repository that we can [clone](./joconde_clone.md) to quickly start a new project

## Setup

### Install the dependencies

```
yarn
```

### Run the project

```
yarn ios
```

or

```
yarn android
```
